      <h2>Describtion</h2>
      <p>
        Koshary is pretty much Egypt's staple street food. You can find anything
        from a 2-story koshary restaurant to a man with a cart on the side of
        the street. It has no meat, but even the biggest of carnivores don't
        miss it.
      </p>

        <li>1 ½ cups short-grain rice, rinsed</li>
        <li>cold water, to cover</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups dark brown lentils</li>
        <li>water to cover</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>

        <li>3 cups chicken stock</li>
        <li>1 (3 ounce) can French-fried onions</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Combine chickpeas, vinegar, coriander, cayenne pepper, and cumin in a
          resealable bag or container with a tight-fitting lid. Store in
          refrigerator while prepping remainder of dish, shaking occasionally.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bring a pot of lightly salted water to a rolling boil. Cook pasta in
          the boiling water until cooked through yet firm to the bite, about 8
          minutes; drain and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
          Combine rice with enough cold water to cover; allow to soak for 20
          minutes. Drain.
        </li>
        <li>
          Meanwhile, combine lentils with enough water to cover in a pot; season
          with salt and pepper. Bring the lentils to a boil and simmer until
          tender, about 30 minutes. Drain.
        </li>
        <li>
          Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat; cook and stir
          onion and garlic in hot oil until translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Add
          crushed tomatoes; season with salt and pepper, reduce heat to
          medium-low, and maintain at a simmer while preparing remainder of
          dish.
        </li>
        <li>
          Melt butter in a pot over medium-high heat; add rice, increase heat to
          high, and fry for 4 to 5 minutes, stirring constantly. Pour in chicken
          stock and bring to a boil. Season with salt and pepper; reduce heat to
          low, cover, and cook until rice is tender, and the liquid has been
          absorbed, about 20 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Mix rice and lentils together on a large serving platter. Spread
          cooked pasta over the rice and lentil mixture. Serve with marinated
          chickpeas, tomato sauce, and French-fried onions.
